# wookie-movies

Create APIs for a Movie listing app.

`To run the project in local machine`

git clone https://github.com/peertwopeer/wookie-movies

cd wookie-movies; npm install


### `node server.js`

wait for db to get connected (I'm using Atlas shared clustor, so it may take couple of seconds.)


after db get's connected you can test the API with your favorite api platform tool, mine is Insomnia

```sample GET API to list movie to fetch data

localhost:8000/movies
{"token":"FSMovies2021"}```
